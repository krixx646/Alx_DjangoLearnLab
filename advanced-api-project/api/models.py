from django.db import models

# In Django, a "model" describes the structure of the data in the database
# (like a blueprint for a table â€” it says what fields exist and how they relate).
# A "serializer" is used to convert model data into formats like JSON (for APIs),
# and also to turn incoming data (like from a web form or request) back into a model.
# Adding comments that explain what each specific model and serializer is for
# makes it easier for anyone reading the code to quickly understand the purpose
# of each one without having to guess or read through all the logic.
